# Stakeholders' Token Vesting dApp

This is a simple DApp that will allow a particular organization to create a vesting schedule for their tokens. Depending on the tokenomics model of a web3 organization, they will have various vesting schedules for different stakeholders like community, investors, pre-sale buyers, founders etc.

## Description
In the dApp:
1. An organization will be able to register themselves and their token (basically spinning off a contract for one ERC20 token).
2. Organisation will be able to mention the type of stakeholder and their vesting period (timelock).
3. Org will be able to whitelist addresses for certain stakeholders (founders, investors etc.).
4. Whitelisted addresses will be able to claim their tokens after the vesting period.
